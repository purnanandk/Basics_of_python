Question 2]
What is the difference between string and variable?

Answer 2]
Variables can store information inside them. Which can include strings, inetergers, float values, Boolean values, etc.
Variables can never be any of the reserved keywords from python, like if , or , and , else , etc.

Where as Strings are something that can be stored inside a variable.
String contains series of characters which can include alphabets, numbers & symbols.
All the information of the string is always stored inside two Double or Single inverted commas (" " or ' ' ).

Question 3]
Describe three different data types.

Answer 3]
List-List is a data structure which stores elements and/or values inside square bracket[].They are mutable and can store multiple repeated values

Set-Set is a data strcture which stores unique elements and/or values inside curly brackets{}.They are mutable

Dictionary-Dictionary is a data strcture which stores information in the form of Key and Value pair, inside curly brackets {Keys:values}. The keys inside the dictionary are unique.

Question 4]
What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?

Answer 4]
An expression is a combination of operators and operands that can produce some other value as output.
For example :  2 + 2

Question 5]
This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
expression and a statement?

Answer 5]
A statement is the command which does something with if-else,nested if,while loops ,for loops
An expression is a combination of values, operators and literals    

Question 6]
After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1

Answer 6]
The bacon will contain 22
bacon=22
bacon + 1
print(bacon)

Question 7]
What should the values of the following two terms be?

Answer 7]
'spam' + 'spamspam'='spamspamspam'
'spam' * 3='spamspamspam'

Question 8]
Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

Answer 8]
A variable cannot be any reserved keyword or any integer, float or Boolean values. Since here 100 is an integer, therefore it cannot be a variable.

Question 9]
What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?

Answer 9]
int() function can be used to get the integer version of a value.
float() function can be used to get the float version of a value.
str() function can be used to get the string version of a value.

Question 10]
Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'

Answer 10]
We know that two or more strings can be concatinated to each other using addition operator ( + ).
And it cannot be added to another datatype.
Here in the given statement 99 is not in the form of a string, while others are.
So, it causes an error after we concatinate them using addition operator ( + ).

This can be fixed by putting the number 99 into inverted commas (thereby converting it into string type) 
or write it as str(99) to do the same.
As follows :
'I have eaten ' + '99' + ' burritos.'
OR
'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'
